# Loops in C++

## AIM  
To explore the use of `for`, `while`, and `do while` loops in C++ for automating repetitive tasks, implementing algorithms, and optimizing control flow in applications.

## THEORY

Loops in C++ are control flow structures that allow repeated execution of a block of code. They are fundamental in programming for:

- Automating repetitive tasks  
- Iterating over data structures  
- Implementing algorithms efficiently  
- Enhancing code modularity and readability  

## Types of Loops in C++

### 1. **For Loop**
Used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.  
Combines initialization, condition check, and increment or decrement in a single line.  
Ideal for counting loops, array traversal, and fixed iteration tasks.

### 2. **While Loop**
Used when the number of iterations is unknown.  
Condition is checked before each iteration.  
Suitable for condition-driven logic such as waiting for user input or sensor data.

### 3. **Do While Loop**
Executes the loop body at least once before checking the condition.  
Useful in scenarios like menu-driven programs or input validation where the loop must run at least once.

## Loop Control Statements

### **Break**
Terminates the loop immediately when a specific condition is met.  
Commonly used in search operations or early exits.

### **Continue**
Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next.  
Helps avoid deeply nested conditions and improves clarity.

## Nested Loops

Nested loops are loops placed inside other loops. They are essential for:

- Generating patterns such as triangles or grids  
- Traversing multi-dimensional arrays or matrices  
- Creating structured outputs like multiplication tables  

In nested loops, the inner loop completes its full cycle for each iteration of the outer loop.

## CONCLUSION

Loops are a cornerstone of C++ programming, enabling efficient repetition, algorithmic logic, and structured control flow. Understanding the differences between `for`, `while`, and `do while` loops along with control statements and optimization techniques empowers developers to write clean, scalable, and high-performance code. Mastery of loops is essential for solving real-world problems, from pattern generation to complex algorithmic tasks.
